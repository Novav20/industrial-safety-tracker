# Industrial Safety & Equipment Tracker

This project is a full-stack web application designed to help industrial teams track safety incidents and manage equipment maintenance schedules. It provides a clean, user-friendly interface for reporting issues and viewing the status of critical equipment, built as part of a comprehensive developer training program.

## Project Status

This repository documents the complete learning journey of building a full-stack application. The code in the `/phase-1-vanilla-js-version` directory represents the **completed first phase**, built entirely with HTML, CSS, and modern vanilla JavaScript.

## Core Features (Phase 1)

*   **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens using a mobile-first approach.
*   **Interactive Mobile Navigation:** A functional "hamburger" menu provides a seamless user experience on smaller devices.
*   **Dynamic Content Rendering:** The equipment list is generated dynamically from a JavaScript data source, separating data from the UI.
*   **Real-time Filtering:** A live search bar allows users to instantly filter the equipment list by name.
*   **Conditional UI:** Conditional styling is applied to highlight equipment that requires maintenance, drawing immediate user attention.
*   **Data Input & Validation:** A functional form allows users to report new safety incidents with client-side validation to prevent empty submissions.
*   **Data Persistence:** Submitted incidents are saved to the browser's **Local Storage**, persisting user data across page reloads and browser sessions.

## Technology Stack (Phase 1)

*   **HTML5:** Used for creating a semantic and accessible content structure.
*   **CSS3:** Used for styling, Flexbox layouts, and responsive design with media queries.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** Used for DOM manipulation, event handling, data management, and client-side logic.
*   **Git & GitHub:** Used for version control and project tracking.

## How to Run

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  Navigate into the `phase-1-vanilla-js-version` directory.
3.  Open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser.
